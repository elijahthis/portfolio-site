# Portfolio Website

My name is **_Elijah_**. I'm a **_Software Engineer_**. Welcome to my portfolio website.

This website was created to showcase and highlight my skills as a **Software Engineer** in a cohesive portfolio format.

### Technologies Used:

- **HTML5**
- **React JS**
- **Sass (CSS Framework)**

The website was originally made with a splendid monochrome theme. I then implemented a beautiful dark theme to make even more appealing. Check out the themes and tell me what you think.

Evaluate the website and don't forget to hit me up if you're interested in working with me, or if you even have any feedback or ideas. Thanks.
